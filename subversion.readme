The source code is stored in subversion repository on Luck at /home/svn/repos/qtftm.
To write to the repository, you must have a username and password in the /home/svn/repos/conf/passwd file; it's trivial to add a new user, just edit the file.
Make sure you put your username and password into the authenticate tab of Tools>Options>Version Control>Subversion in Qt Creator if you're using it.

There is a mirror repository on Serena at /home/svn/mirror, which contains a backup version of both repositories (qtftm and bbacq).
It is configured for use with the svnsync synchronize command, and it must be done with username syncuser and password mmwavgrp.
To back up the repository, the command must be run manually (from either machine), and the svnserve daemon must be running on the remote machine.
If we had permanant IP addresses or hostnames, this could easily be wrapped into the post-commit hook script, or set up as a cron job.
For now, we do not have those, so it is a good idea to sync the mirror periodically.
